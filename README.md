In this project I built a simple two-player tic tac toe game. This helped me practice module and factory functions in JavaScript and avoid using global variables to make the application more scalable. In order to improve this project, I would work more on styling of the page and add an option to play against the computer moves of which I would calculate to made the game medium difficulty.I would also add a function that does not allow adding more marks after the winner was chosen.
